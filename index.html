            <content><p>My name is Gabriele Cimolino. I’m a classically educated computer scientist with some diverse interests. Mostly, I’m interested in computers, games, and the intelligences that play them. I recently moved to Halifax with my wife, Kayleigh, and my little dog, Hector, so now I’m looking for interesting things to do there.</p>

<p>I spent thirteen years studying at Queen’s University and writing my own software. I especially like programming video games; you can find some of my gaming projects on my <a href="./projects.html">projects</a> page. For my PhD thesis, I made AI that helps people with disabilities to play video games and I studied how players understand, and sometimes misunderstand, AI assistance.</p></content>
